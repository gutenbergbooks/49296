<p class="description">S<small>CENE</small>—<i>A Drawing Room fitted up for an evening
party—to the left a card table—doors</i>, <small>C</small>. <i>and</i>
<small>L</small>.</p>

<p class="description">T<small>HWAITES</small>, <i>who has finished lighting candles in
chandelier at back</i>, <small>C</small>., <i>steps back to survey the effect.</i></p>

<p>T<small>HWAITES</small>. Now, that’s what I call the real thing—the clean grit. The
position of that bokey (<i>bouquet</i>) is such, that none but the purest taste could
conceive,—those camellias, chastity itself. A fine combination! Cutting the turnips and
carrots to make ornaments for the cold tongue; chusing the bokies at Covent Garden Market;
mildly tempering the brilliant light of wax and gas with the soothing hue of flowers. I
have brought all my arts to bear upon this sworry. The party who is a greengrocer in the
morning, is the only perfect waiter in the evening.</p>

<p class="entrance"><i>Enter</i> A<small>GATHA</small>, <small>C</small>.</p>

<p>A<small>GATHA</small>. (<small>L</small>.) So, Thwaites, the room appears quite
ready?</p>

<p>T<small>HWAITES</small>. (<small>R</small>.) Yes, Miss Agatha; without exaggeration I
may venture to say, we are lit up.</p>

<p>A<small>GATHA</small>. My father has not returned?</p>

<p>T<small>HWAITES</small>. No, Miss Agatha, he has not—since he left the house at two in
the afternoon—I haven’t the slightest notion where he is gone.</p>

<p>A<small>GATHA</small>. Indeed! (<i>laughing—sits</i>,
<small>L</small>.&nbsp;<small>C</small>.)</p>

<p>T<small>HWAITES</small>. No—though I did my best to ascertain;—“Are you going far,
sir?” says I. He stares, and he makes me no answer. “Shall you be long, sir?” says I. He
stares again, and again he makes no answer. “Because sir,” says I, “there’s the party this
evening!” “I know that, better <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-4">[Pg
4]</a></span>than you do,” says he, “for I shall have to pay for it!”—just like him, Miss
Agatha—ha, ha, ha!</p>

<p>A<small>GATHA</small>. (<i>aside—vexed</i>) Really, ’pa must have a regular footman;
these tradespeople whom he engages as occasional waiters don’t understand subordination a
bit.</p>

<p>T<small>HWAITES</small>. I hope you admire the bokies, Miss Agatha; them camellias are
quite the thing, I flatter myself;—all my taste—ha! ha! You’ll be called to-morrow the
Lady of the Camellias!</p>

<p>A<small>GATHA</small>. Most offensive! (<i>rises, and turns aside</i>)</p>

<p>T<small>HWAITES</small>. Now, I thought I had said something very pretty—but she don’t
look pleased.</p>

<p>A<small>GATHA</small>. No one has arrived, of course?</p>

<p>T<small>HWAITES</small>. On the contrary, Miss Agatha—I’m sorry to differ from you, but
I rather think one has arrived, and is coffee-ing in the back parlor;—here he is, too!</p>

<p class="entrance"><i>Enter</i> W<small>HITEWASH</small>, <small>C</small>. <i>from</i>
<small>L</small>.&nbsp;<small>C</small>., <i>and down</i>, <small>C</small>.</p>

<p class="noindent">Mr. Whitewash, as I’m alive!—No occasion to announce you, sir.</p>

<p>W<small>HITE</small> (<small>C</small>.). Ah, my dear Miss De Windsor, excuse me if I
stopped a minute to refresh myself with a <i>demitasse</i> of your choice Mocha instead of
flying up stairs; but you see, a cause in which I was retained came on late, and I was
obliged to exert myself a good deal—abnormally—if I may use the expression;—in short I was
regularly knocked up.</p>

<p>A<small>GATHA</small>. Don’t think of apologies—as it is you are the first in the room.
So you have had another brief to-day—I hope you have been victorious.</p>

<p>W<small>HITE</small>. One of my most brilliant triumphs! I actually outshone myself!
(T<small>HWAITES</small> <i>listens</i>) A rascal had stolen a watch from a gentleman’s
pocket, and hid it!—ha, ha, ha!—in his umbrella.</p>

<p>T<small>HWAITES</small>. Watch in an umbrella—come, that’s not bad!—ho, ho, ho!</p>

<p>W<small>HITE</small>. Eh? (<i>looks half offended—then continues without noticing</i>
T<small>HWAITES</small>) There is not the slightest doubt that the scoundrel was guilty;
indeed he had such a face that innocence would have been a positive fraud upon nature—but,
<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-5">[Pg 5]</a></span>ha, ha, ha! I got
him off—I got him off!—a weeping jury declared that he was not guilty.</p>

<p>A<small>GATHA</small>. Capital!</p>

<p>T<small>HWAITES</small>. Which it is capital!—just like you, sir.</p>

<p>W<small>HITE</small>. (<i>draws</i> A<small>GATHA</small> <i>aside</i>) I say—this
person—rather familiar.</p>

<p>A<small>GATHA</small>. Yes, I know—I’m quite annoyed. He’s our greengrocer. ’Pa jokes
with him in the morning when he buys the vegetables, and now he’s come to wait in the
evening, he don’t understand his position at all.</p>

<p>W<small>HITE</small>. I think I’ll take the liberty of dropping a hint. I say,
Mr.——</p>

<p>T<small>HWAITES</small>. Thwaites, at your service, sir. Cards ain’t common in our
business; but my address is——</p>

<p>W<small>HITE</small>. Of your address, Mr. Thwaites, I have not the slightest doubt.
But I would speak a word with you.</p>

<p>T<small>HWAITES</small>. And I’ll listen if you talk for an hour. If I take up the
newspaper, is it to read about politics? No! About plays?—No, I should rather think not!
About pictures? bother, no! I look to see if Mr. Whitewash has been saying something for
some poor devil in the Central Criminal Court. That’s my intellectual treat!</p>

<p>W<small>HITE</small>. (<i>flattered</i>) Indeed! ha! ha! Really, my dear Miss de
Windsor we should do wrong to check this diffusion of intelligence among the masses.</p>

<p class="entrance"><i>Enter</i> D<small>E</small> W<small>INDSOR</small>,
<small>C</small>. <i>from</i> <small>L</small>.&nbsp;<small>C</small>.</p>

<p>D<small>E</small> W. He is here—is he—the dear boy. I must shake him by the hand.
(<i>rushes forward</i>, <small>R</small>.&nbsp;<small>C</small>. <i>and grasps
</i>T<small>HWAITES</small> <i>by the hand</i>) Eh! ha! ha! You’re not Whitewash!
Ridiculous! I’m always making myself ridiculous; I’ve too much heart. You feel what I
mean, Whitewash. (<i>shakes his hand violently</i>) You feel what I mean.</p>

<p>W<small>HITE</small>. (<small>L</small>.&nbsp;<small>C</small>.) Most acutely!
(<i>wringing his hand</i>)</p>

<p>D<small>E</small> W. I’m so glad you are here before the others. Leave the room,
Thwaites. (T<small>HWAITES</small> <i>lingers, moving at back to</i> <small>C</small>.) I
can now disburden my heart. As I said, I’m all heart. (T<small>HWAITES</small>
<i>advances</i>, <small>C</small>.) Leave the room, Thwaites! (T<small>HWAITES</small>
<i>goes up, and moves chair from</i> <small>R</small>. <i>to</i> <small>C</small>.) This
moment is the most important—Zounds! Thwaites, will you leave the room?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>T<small>HWAITES</small>. (<i>aside, going up,</i> <small>C</small>.) That’s the man of
money. Give me the man of mind!</p>

<p class="direction_r"><i>Exit</i>, <small>C</small>., <i>off</i>, <small>L</small>.</p>

<p>D<small>E</small> W. (<i>coming to</i> <small>C</small>.) Now look, I hesitate no
longer; I shilly-shally no longer; I follow the dictates of my heart, and my heart tells
me to—Come here, Whitewash—come here, Aggy. (<i>joins their hands</i>) Whitewash, consider
yourself as my son-in-law.</p>

<p>A<small>GATHA</small>. Really, this is very sudden, ’pa.</p>

<p>D<small>E</small> W. Of course it is; I’m always sudden, I’m a creature of impulse. But
do you dislike the arrangement?</p>

<p>A<small>GATHA</small>. I did not say that, ’pa.</p>

<p>D<small>E</small> W. Didn’t say that, ’pa! Then why don’t you speak out? Wear your mind
in your face, as I do, or as my young friend here, with whom I want to speak a few words
in private. So, go and see how they are getting on with the coffee.</p>

<p>W<small>HITE</small>. (<small>R</small>.) And don’t forget, that you are engaged to me
for the first set, and the Polka, and the Lancers.</p>

<p>D<small>E</small> W. Of course, she won’t forget. Run along child.</p>

<p class="direction_r"><i>Exit</i>, A<small>GATHA</small>, <small>C</small>., <i>off</i>,
<small>L</small>.</p>

<p class="noindent">Now, I can give vent to my feelings; Whitewash, you’ve done it. I was
long making up my mind, but now, you’ve done it. You are one of the men I like. (<i>shakes
his hand violently—they sit</i>)</p>

<p>W<small>HITE</small>. My dear sir, I’m most happy. (<i>wringing his hand</i>)</p>

<p>D<small>E</small> W. Of course you are. Look you, it’s only now that I like you; this
very morning I weighed your merits with those of Tom Tango of the Stock Exchange, who you
know has a sneaking kindness for my girl, and the balance was considerably in Tom’s
favour. He’s a better looking fellow than you, and his conversation is more agreeable.
Then, what’s a lawyer? said I, a creature all brains and no heart? no heart, sir! But now,
I’m changed, my views are more enlarged—more expansive—I have been——</p>

<p>W<small>HITE</small>. Dining out?</p>

<p>D<small>E</small> W. No, I have been in the Central Criminal Court, during the cause,
“The Queen <i>v.</i> Pawkins.”</p>

<p>W<small>HITE</small>. Ah, I see! and you heard my speech for the defence. It was not
bad, was it?</p>

<p>D<small>E</small> W. It was noble—it was glorious. While I looked upon that poor man in
the dock, and I heard you enunciate <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage"
id="page-7">[Pg 7]</a></span>his virtues and expatiate on the largeness of his small
family, he assumed in my eyes the sanctity of a martyr.</p>

<p>W<small>HITE</small>. You don’t say so?</p>

<p>D<small>E</small> W. Perhaps you noticed that among the persons in the court one wept
aloud—very loud?</p>

<p>W<small>HITE</small>. I did. The policeman turned him out, I believe.</p>

<p>D<small>E</small> W. True—ahem! Some such brutal occurrence did take place; I was the
man that wept, sir, you were the man that made me weep; you touched my heart, sir, you
touched my heart.</p>

<p>W<small>HITE</small>. (<i>aside</i>) Really, a most sensible old gentleman!</p>

<p>D<small>E</small> W. Lingering at the door, I learned that the prisoner was acquitted.
So I walked home, and I said to myself—Whitewash is my destined son-in-law. I as a
manufacturer of fancy soap remove physical impurities from the skin; Whitewash effaces the
blots that calumny has cast upon innocence.</p>

<p>W<small>HITE</small>. Innocence!</p>

<p>D<small>E</small> W. Of course; no one knows better than you that that poor persecuted
being was innocence itself.</p>

<p>W<small>HITE</small>. (<i>coolly</i>) Oh, yes—yes.</p>

<p>D<small>E</small> W. What delight you must have felt in restoring him to his weeping
wife, and those five small children!</p>

<p>W<small>HITE</small>. Wife! children! Oh! ah! I believe I did use the expression.</p>

<p>D<small>E</small> W. But there’s a further pleasure in store for you. You know I always
follow the dictates of my heart. Well—well, my heart told me that society owed that poor
persecuted being a reparation, and was bound to declare that he had not forfeited his
social position. In a word, sir, I’ve invited him to my ball this evening.</p>

<p>W<small>HITE</small>. (<i>rises</i>) Here? To your house? A fellow with the taint of
the dock fresh upon him!</p>

<p>D<small>E</small> W. A taint that he did not merit—a taint that you have so nobly

<p>A<small>GATHA</small>. The—the—governor?</p>

<p>P<small>AWKINS</small>. Yes, the gov’ner here; not my gov’ner—no, bless you, he’s been
under hatches long ago. I want Mr.—I’ve got his letter somewhere—Mr.—he’s something in the
fancy soap line.</p>

<p>A<small>GATHA</small>. Oh, my papa—Mr. De Windsor.</p>

<p>P<small>AWKINS</small>. Him’s it! So he’s your papa, is he? Well then, I say you do him

<p>A<small>GATHA</small>. (<i>aside</i>) A singularly vulgar person! but ’pa does pick up
such strange friends in the City.</p>

<p>P<small>AWKINS</small>. Before we go any further I should like to settle one pint: I’ve
picked up this here gimcrack thing on the staircase. (<i>producing bracelet from his coat

<p class="direction_r"><i>Exit</i> A<small>GATHA</small>, <small>C</small>.</p>

<p>P<small>AWKINS</small>. A thousand, thousand thanks!—my dear sir, too! Uncommon pretty

of good manners. A shilling slipped in one’s hand <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage"

can’t have it all one’s own way; then her pretty smile were worth more nor a shilling a

up bracelets, and gives them to the right owner, ain’t exactly the sort of article as
prigs watches.</p>

<p>D<small>E</small> W. (<small>L</small>.) Really a charming scene! most exhilarating!
(<i>sees</i> P<small>AWKINS</small>, <small>R</small>.) Eh! why, he’s here at last!
Pawkins, the persecuted! (<i>shakes his hand violently</i>) My dear sir, I’m delighted to

<p>P<small>AWKINS</small>. (<i>wringing his hand</i>) Thank you; but draw it a little
mild.</p>

<p>D<small>E</small> W. (<small>L</small>.) Mr. Pawkins, you are one of the men I
like.</p>

<p>P<small>AWKINS</small>. Same to you, sir. You are Mr. De—de—fancy soap line, sir?</p>

<p>D<small>E</small> W. De Windsor.</p>

<p>P<small>AWKINS</small>. Well then, sir, two minutes ago I told the young ’oman she was
a credit to you, and now I don’t mind telling you you’re a credit to the young ’oman.</p>

<p>D<small>E</small> W. (<i>aside</i>) Somewhat coarse; but frank and genial.</p>

<p>P<small>AWKINS</small>. You’ve sent me a sort o’ note, sir, as the saying is, asking me
to come here; but it strikes me there’s some mistake.</p>

<p>D<small>E</small> W. Not in the least, Mr. Pawkins, not in the least. Take a seat.</p>

<p>P<small>AWKINS</small>. (<i>sits</i>, <small>R</small>. <i>after putting down
umbrella</i>, <small>R</small>.) That’s all right then. At all events I’ve brought the
tongs in my pocket.</p>

<p>D<small>E</small> W. The tongs?—rather a singular proceeding!—and the shovel?</p>

<p>P<small>AWKINS</small>. No; get out with you—I mean the curling irons.</p>

<p>D<small>E</small> W. (<i>coldly</i>) I—I begin to comprehend; Mr. Pawkins, you are a
hair-dresser.</p>

<p>P<small>AWKINS</small>. No; that’s where you put your foot in it. I ain’t a regular
hair-dresser for a nobby concern like this. I cuts a little in the common way, but I am
chiefly in the easy shaving line.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>D<small>E</small> W. I understand, you keep a hair-cutting saloon frequented by
gentlemen only.</p>

<p>P<small>AWKINS</small>. I calls it a shop, sir, but if you calls it a s’loon it’s werry
kind on you, and I’m much obliged, and if you calls my customers gen’leman, they ought to
be werry much obliged to you too.</p>

<p>D<small>E</small> W. (<i>aside</i>) Ha! I wish he had been a little higher in the
social scale—but no matter. His wrongs have been extraordinary, society owes him an
extraordinary reparation. Mr. Pawkins, I trust Mrs. Pawkins and the children are quite
well?</p>

<p>P<small>AWKINS</small>. Mrs. Pawkins and the children—ha, ha, ha! Them’s as well as can
be expected.</p>

<p>D<small>E</small> W. I see—a recent increase to the family.</p>

<p>P<small>AWKINS</small>. Recent gammon! Why there ain’t no Mrs. Pawkins—there ain’t even
a young un.</p>

<p>D<small>E</small> W. Bless me! (<i>aside</i>) I’m sure Whitewash talked about small

<p class="entrance">W<small>HITEWASH</small> <i>runs in</i> <small>C</small>. <i>from</i>

<p>D<small>E</small> W. (<small>L</small>.) Ah, sir, Mr. Whitewash is your true
friend.</p>

<p>P<small>AWKINS</small>. No mistake about that! No, Mr. Whitewash, I’m a poor man, but
if there’s any way of shewing my gratitude——</p>

<p>W<small>HITE</small>. (<i>whispers</i>) There’s an exceedingly cheap way. Make some
excuse and take yourself off as fast as your legs can carry you.</p>

<p>P<small>AWKINS</small>. Ah, he is indeed a friend! (<i>crosses to</i>
<small>C</small>.) Look here, Mr. De——what’s your name? There I stud reading the bill of
the Royal Victoria Theatre—something about Will Watch, the Bold Smuggler, when, as if it
was done o’ purpose, some one smuggles a watch into my umbrella!</p>

<p>W<small>HITE</small>. Yes, yes, we know all about that, the story <span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-11">[Pg 11]</a></span>is exceedingly
plausible, and I have told it already, much better than you can, in the presence of this
gentleman.</p>

<p>P<small>AWKINS</small>. They lugs me about—they takes me off against my will.</p>

<p>W<small>HITE</small>. Well, then, now indulge in the free exercise of your will, by
taking yourself off.</p>

<p>P<small>AWKINS</small>. Stop a bit! though I mostly sticks to the easy shaving line,
I’ve a mind as can soar to the higher branches. That ’ere head of hair is uncommon well

<p class="direction_r"><i>Exit</i>, <small>C</small>., <i>and off</i>,
<small>R</small>.</p>

<p>D<small>E</small> W. (<small>L</small>.) Exuberant—unsophisticated creature!</p>

<p>W<small>HITE</small>. Oh, perfectly unsophisticated! I only wish he had not fixed on
the only head dress in the room that gives a notion of positive value? No, no, I must not
hesitate any longer. Look here, my dear, sir, you are a man of heart—I may say, a noble
creature—and it’s one of the specific weaknesses of noble creatures, to fancy everybody
else as noble as themselves. Now, suppose this favourite of yours, this Pawkins, were
really a little light fingered; suppose the dazzling brilliancy of one of your table
spoons caused him to forget the distinction between <i>meum</i> and <i>tuum</i>. Under
these painful circumstances, what would you say?</p>

<p>D<small>E</small> W. I should say that you were the most lying humbug I ever clapped
eyes on.</p>

<p>W<small>HITE</small>. Heyday! Why?</p>

<p>D<small>E</small> W. Why, didn’t you stand up before the judge and jury, and bellow out
your belief in that man’s immaculate virtue. Did you not clap your hand on your heart, and
declare that our country might be proud of such a citizen; and St. Giles’s in the Fields
proud of such a parishioner? Did not you cause me to blubber aloud, till I was turned
ignominiously out of court, as a charity boy is kicked out by a beadle? And am I to
understand that all that rhodomontade, followed by that expulsion, was for the sake of a
pickpocket? Abominable! Disgusting!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>W<small>HITE</small>. But surely, you understand, my dear sir, that when one speaks
professionally——</p>

<p>D<small>E</small> W. Sir, no one has business to tell lies, professionally or not; a
man should always speak what he thinks. I follow the dictates of my heart, and I always
speak what I think; my heart is in my heart, and my heart is in my mouth.</p>

<p>W<small>HITE</small>. What a complicated piece of anatomy you must be.</p>

<p>D<small>E</small> W. I say, my heart is in my mouth.</p>

<p>W<small>HITE</small>. Then I wish you would swallow it, and say no more about it.</p>

<p>D<small>E</small> W. Yes, I dare say you think that a very good joke, but what I am
going to tell you is no joke. If Pawkins is a thief, you shan’t have my daughter, and
Tango shall.</p>

<p>W<small>HITE</small>. Monstrous!</p>

<p>D<small>E</small> W. Not at all, I give you my girl because I regard you as a noble
defender of persecuted innocence; but if persecuted innocence turns out to be a low
pilfering scoundrel, I naturally retract.</p>

<p>W<small>HITE</small>. But, my dear, sir, the doctrine you so strangely maintain is
diametrically opposed to the very principles of British jurisprudence. It is one of the
high privileges of our blessed country, and of several others, that even the vilest and
meanest criminal is allowed a professional defender in the courts of justice.</p>

<p>D<small>E</small> W. Sir, it is one of the high privileges of our blessed country, and
of several others, that a man need not give away his daughter where he don’t like.</p>

<p>W<small>HITE</small>. But, sir, by virtue of my profession I am positively bound
to——</p>

<p>D<small>E</small> W. Well, I don’t say you’re not. But an honest man, sir, should have
nothing to do with clients that don’t come into court with clean hands.</p>

<p>W<small>HITE</small>. My dear Mr. De Windsor, borrow a little wisdom from your own
business. If everybody had clean hands, what would become of the soap trade?</p>

<p>D<small>E</small> W. Go, go, and defend every pickpocket, forger, coiner, housebreaker,
in London. I don’t want to hinder you, I only say that I won’t give my daughter to a man
<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-13">[Pg 13]</a></span>who makes
respectable people blubber till they are shoved out of court, on purpose to defeat the
ends of justice.</p>

<p>W<small>HITE</small>. Then, sir, I suppose, because he furthers the ends of justice,
you would give your daughter to the hangman.</p>

<p>D<small>E</small> W. (<i>puzzled</i>) Ahem! I shall not condescend to answer an
argument so obviously sophistical. I only repeat what I said before. If Pawkins is a thief
you sha’n’t have my daughter.</p>

<p>W<small>HITE</small>. (<i>aside</i>) Reason is wasted on this old blockhead! I must try
another tack. (<i>aloud</i>) Ah, you have passed nobly through the ordeal. Just to sound
you I hinted at the remote possibility of Pawkins’ guilt, but he is in point of fact, as
we both know, innocent as the babe unborn. Did not the jury say so? However, ta, ta! for
the present, sir. (<i>aside</i>) I must look out, egad! I was only retained as the
rascal’s counsel, but I find I am his bail.</p>

<p class="direction_r"><i>Exit</i>, <small>C</small>., <i>off</i> <small>L</small>.</p>

what was your intention?</p>

<p>P<small>AWKINS</small>. Why, I com’d here in the hope of doing something in the way of
business.</p>

<p>W<small>HITE</small>. Business, indeed! Why, there were all the streets of London open
to your ingenuity, and you must <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-14">[Pg

<small>R</small>.)</p>

<p>P<small>AWKINS</small>. (<i>following him up</i>) Well, I didn’t know it was your
father-in-law—and if it is, what’s the hodds? This ’ere Mr.—summat in the fancy soap line,
sends me a hinwite, and so I comes with the tongs in my pocket—well, it turns out he don’t
want the tongs, but he’s taken a likin’ to me. That arn’t no fault o’ mine is it? I never
tries to be extra agreeable. (<i>returns to</i> <small>C</small>. <i>of stage</i>)</p>

<p>W<small>HITE</small>. (<i>aside</i>) Perhaps the miserable wretch has commenced
already. What have you been doing with yourself?</p>

<p>P<small>AWKINS</small>. Why, I’ve been a looking at them silver gimcracks on the
sideboard, and I says to myself—my eyes! if one of them five thingumbobs as don’t seem no
use here belonged to me——</p>

<p>W<small>HITE</small>. (<i>aside</i>) Unhappy train of thought! Allow me for a

<p>P<small>AWKINS</small>. You’re a spoon yourself! It’s the tongs.</p>

<p>W<small>HITE</small>. For a wonder he speaks the truth. Now mark, I’m your professional
adviser, and I advise you to be off as soon as you can.</p>

<p>P<small>AWKINS</small>. Well, I don’t mind; I’ve seen all there is to be seen, and it

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>P<small>AWKINS</small>. Pick hay? I knows nuffin about pick hay; I was werry nigh being
sent to pick oakum!</p>

<p>D<small>E</small> W. Well, what shall we play? Suppose we cut for a shilling a
game.</p>

<p>P<small>AWKINS</small>. A shilling! Come! I was thinking of a fourpenny bit; but
there’s nothing like pluck. I say, I hopes you keeps your temper when you loses, for I
give you fair warning, I shan’t let you go till I’ve got something out of you.</p>

Bolted, by jingo!</p>

<p>D<small>E</small> W. (<i>coming down</i>, <small>R</small>.&nbsp;<small>C</small>.)
Allow me, my dear, Mr. Ferguson, to introduce you to my intended son-in-law.</p>

<p>F<small>ERGUS</small>. (<i>down</i> <small>R</small>.) Sir, allow me to congwatulate
you on your vewy interwesting position.</p>

<p>D<small>E</small> W. Mr. Whitewash, sir, is one of the brightest ornaments of the legal
profession, and this gentleman is one of his most ornamental clients.</p>

<p>F<small>ERGUS</small>. Vewy much delighted. (<i>bowing to</i> P<small>AWKINS</small>)
Heyday! Here is certainly a party who has taken me by surpwise.</p>

<p>D<small>E</small> W. What do you mean?</p>

<p>F<small>ERGUS</small>. I mean that a certain party, a fwiend of mine, found that party
(<i>pointing to</i> P<small>AWKINS</small>) in his cupboard, at thwee o’clock in the
morning.</p>

<p>D<small>E</small> W. (<small>R</small>.&nbsp;<small>C</small>.) All right! You are
quite sure of your man?</p>

<p>F<small>ERGUS</small>. (<small>R</small>.) Oh, perfectly! (<i>aside</i>) Seeing that
the fwiend was myself. (<i>goes up a little</i>)</p>

<p>D<small>E</small> W. (<i>rubs his hands</i>) Capital! capital! Tango wins the day!</p>

<p>W<small>HITE</small>. (<i>seated</i>, <small>L</small>.&nbsp;<small>C</small>.)
Father-in-law looks pleased—that’s unlucky. (<i>rises</i>)</p>

<p>D<small>E</small> W. Come here, my orator! come here, my Cicero! I’ve a bit of news for
you;—Tango will have my daughter—ha, ha, ha! (<i>pokes</i> W<small>HITEWASH</small> <i>in
the ribs</i>)</p>

<p>W<small>HITE</small>. (<small>L</small>.&nbsp;<small>C</small>.) What, sir! you, a man
of heart, who have given your word to me——</p>

<p>D<small>E</small> W. Yes, if Pawkins turned out all right; but he don’t—he don’t—he
don’t—ha, ha, ha!</p>

<p>W<small>HITE</small>. Mr. De Windsor, allow me to remark, that an innocent man’s
character is not to be impugned without sufficient ground. Come here, Pawkins.
(<i>whispers to him</i>, “Brazen it out”) Pawkins, a malignant slanderer says you are
fishy, but you ain’t, are you?</p>

<p>P<small>AWKINS</small>. (<small>L</small>.) Not as I am aware on.</p>

<p>D<small>E</small> W. Then, most respectable Mr. Pawkins, what were you doing in a
certain cupboard at three o’clock in the morning?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>W<small>HITE</small>. Ha! the case is desperate, and a desperate effort must be
made.</p>

<p class="entrance">A<small>GATHA</small> <i>and several</i> G<small>UESTS</small>
<i>enter from</i> <small>L</small>.&nbsp;<small>C</small>., <i>and form an</i>
A<small>UDIENCE</small>, <small>R</small>.</p>

<p class="noindent">Listen, all parties present.</p>

<p>D<small>E</small> W. (<small>R</small>.&nbsp;<small>C</small>.) Well, talk away, and
make the best of it.</p>

<p>W<small>HITE</small>. Look at the face of this worthy man. Pawkins, get into the dock!
(<i>places him on chair</i>, <small>L</small>., <i>and turns another chair round to lean
on, &amp;c.</i>) Examine every lineament.</p>

<p>P<small>AWKINS</small>. (<i>on chair</i>, <small>L</small>.) Come, come, you do make
one look such a fool!</p>

<p>W<small>HITE</small>. (<small>L</small>.&nbsp;<small>C</small>.) Believe me, this
excellent man is one of those rare natures that are seldom to be found. Ask the
independent electors of Marylebone, whom they would place in the van.</p>

<p>P<small>AWKINS</small>. I’ve been in the wan!</p>

<p>W<small>HITE</small>. Whom they would place in the van as the staunchest champion of
their interests. They will answer Pawkins! Ask the poor——(<i>takes tongs from his own
pocket</i>)</p>

<p>P<small>AWKINS</small>. Them’s my tongs!</p>

<p>W<small>HITE</small>. (<i>throws them on table</i>) Ask the poor—the suffering
poor—whom they regard as their kindest benefactor. They will answer—Pawkins. (<i>aside to
him</i>) Cry!</p>

<p>P<small>AWKINS</small>. I can’t! I say, ain’t you pitching it raither too strong!</p>

<p>W<small>HITE</small>. They say we were found in a cupboard at three o’clock in the
morning. Well, we admit the trivial fact, we were in the cupboard.</p>

<p>P<small>AWKINS</small>. No, no, no!</p>

<p>W<small>HITE</small>. Though we have every high virtue, we are still but human; we have
hearts not altogether unsusceptible to female beauty. (F<small>ERGUSON</small> <i>comes
forward</i>, <small>R</small>., <i>in great agitation</i>) Do you now persist in asking
why we were in the cupboard? Well, then, we were there for the sake of one of the fair
sex.</p>

<p>F<small>ERGUS</small>. But, sir, there is a husband——</p>

<p>P<small>AWKINS</small>. Now he’s done it!</p>

<p>W<small>HITE</small>. A husband! Do you call that a husband? As Mr. Justice Blesswell
remarked in the great divorce <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-20">[Pg
20]</a></span>case of Martyr <i>v.</i> Bangwife—such a wretch is not worthy the name of a
husband. A man who indulges in large potations—comes home at little hours—and is limited
in his notions of crinoline! (<i>bangs chair during speech, then turns it and
sits</i>)</p>

<p>P<small>AWKINS</small>. He’ll smash that ere chair!</p>

<p>F<small>ERGUS</small>. But, sir, I’m the husband——</p>

<p>W<small>HITE</small>. (<i>rises and goes to</i> P<small>AWKINS</small>) That’s
awkward!</p>

<p>P<small>AWKINS</small>. Yes; it is awkward!</p>

<p>W<small>HITE</small>. But we won’t flinch! Mr. De Windsor, I must say your society is
not the most select. (<i>pulls chair from under</i> P<small>AWKINS</small>)</p>

<p>F<small>ERGUS</small>. (<i>crossing to</i> <small>L</small>., <i>and collaring</i>
P<small>AWKINS</small>) And now, you villain—you destwoyer of my domestic peace—what have
you to say for yourself?</p>

<p>P<small>AWKINS</small>. Why, I cannot say nuffing, while you goes on choking me like
that! (F<small>ERGUSON</small> <i>lets go</i>) That’s better! Well, then, I didn’t have no
thoughts about Mrs. Ferguson—Mrs. Ferguson don’t come up to my hideas of female beauty.
(<i>snaps his fingers</i>) That for Mrs. Ferguson! If you will tear from me the secrets of
my ’art, I com’d arter Jemima, Mrs. Ferguson’s young ’oman—there, now, ye knows all about
it. I’ve told the truth, and I can shame—Ferguson!</p>

<p>T<small>HWAITES</small>. (<i>comes forward</i>, <small>L</small>.) So, Mr. Pawkins, it
was Mrs. Ferguson’s Jemima, was it? Are you aware, sir, that I pay my attentions in that
quarter? Are you aware that I’m Thwaites?</p>

<p>P<small>AWKINS</small>. Are you, indeed?—who says you ain’t? There ain’t no advantage
in being Thwaites, as I sees—I don’t want to be Thwaites. You’re one of them swells as
takes out a young ’oman on a holiday, and grumbles at the expense all the blessed way
there, and all the blessed way back;—you prefers the ha’penny boat to the penny, and you
prefers walking to heither. Thwaites, you ain’t the favored man, so drop Miss Jemima;—I
don’t say what I’ll do if you don’t—but just take an ’int, and drop Miss Jemima.</p>

<p class="direction_r">(A<small>GATHA</small> <i>and</i> D<small>E</small>

<p>D<small>E</small> W. (<small>R</small>.&nbsp;<small>C</small>.) Disgustingly so, my
dear—but join the guests, and make the best of it. (A<small>GATHA</small> <i>retires
up</i>)</p>

<p>W<small>HITE</small>. (<i>coming forward</i>, <small>C</small>.) Well, father-in-law, I
hope you are satisfied now!</p>

<p>D<small>E</small> W. Mr. Pawkins, I have an apology to make to you—you’ll think it very
absurd—but I—I—ha, ha!—I scarcely know how to express it—but I actually took you for a
thief!</p>

<p>P<small>AWKINS</small>. (<small>L</small>.&nbsp;<small>C</small>.) You ain’t the first,
else I shouldn’t have been tried at the Hold Bailey this morning. Look ye—a fellow chucks
a watch into my umbrella——</p>

<p>W<small>HITE</small>. (<small>C</small>.) Yes, yes, we know all about that; besides, you are completely
cleared.</p>

<p>D<small>E</small> W. (<small>R</small>.) Perfectly; your character is as cloudless as a
fine day in July, and I am about to give you the most convincing proof of my
confidence.</p>

<p>P<small>AWKINS</small>. (<i>aside</i>) He’s going to ask me to shave him!</p>

<p>D<small>E</small> W. (<i>crossing to</i> <small>C</small>.) I have long been looking
out for a man of indubitable integrity, to act as my cashier; I keep nearly the whole of
my fortune locked up in a strong box, so I may as well give you the key now. (<i>about to
give key</i>, W<small>HITEWASH</small> <i>hastily comes between them</i>)</p>

<p>W<small>HITE</small>. (<small>C</small>., <i>intercepting</i>) No! no! what are you
about? A thief!—a common pickpocket!</p>

<p>D<small>E</small> W. (<small>R</small>.) Ha, ha! victory!—you admit it, do you?</p>

<p class="direction_r">(<i>retires to</i> G<small>UESTS</small>, <small>R</small>.)</p>

<p>W<small>HITE</small>. (<i>aside</i>) Caught, by all that’s unlucky!</p>

<p>P<small>AWKINS</small>. (<small>L</small>.) Come, I say, master, this ’ere won’t do: when I looks black,
you makes me white; and when I’m whitened, you makes me black: I’ve a jolly good mind
to——</p>

<p>W<small>HITE</small>. Oh, go to the devil!</p>

<p class="entrance"><i>Enter</i> T<small>HWAITES</small>, <small>C</small>. <i>from</i>
<small>L</small>., <i>with a letter.</i></p>

<p>T<small>HWAITES</small>. (<i>to</i> W<small>HITEWASH</small>) Please, sir, a knowin’
party, as calls himself your clerk, has brought this. (<i>gives letter to</i>
W<small>HITEWASH</small>; W<small>HITEWASH</small> <i>opens letter at first with
indifference, but proceeds to read with eagerness;</i> D<small>E</small>

<p>D<small>E</small> W. (<small>R</small>.&nbsp;<small>C</small>.) My dear, this matter is

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>A<small>GATHA</small>. (<small>R</small>.) La, papa! how shocking!</p>

<p>F<small>ERGUS</small>. (<i>coming down</i> <small>R</small>.) I beg your pardon; you
don’t mean Tom Tango, of the Stock Exchange?</p>

<p>D<small>E</small> W. Yes, I do.</p>

<p>A<small>GATHA</small>. Then you haven’t heard the news: he was declared a defaulter
this vewy afternoon.</p>

<p>D<small>E</small> W. The devil! One swindles—another tells lies: where can I find an
honest man?</p>

<p>W<small>HITE</small>. (<i>rises, having been seated while reading letter</i>) Here!
(<i>leading</i> P<small>AWKINS</small> <i>forward</i>) Look at that face—and read that
letter? (<i>gives it</i>) The sum and substance of it is this: A notorious pickpocket has
just been arrested, and retains me for the defence—confessing that he threw the watch into
Pawkins’ umbrella.</p>

<p>P<small>AWKINS</small>. Does he? Then there’s some good in the waggerbone after
all.</p>

<p>D<small>E</small> W. Well,—as a barrister who twaddles, is better than a stock jobber
who waddles—here’s my daughter. (<i>joins the hands of</i> W<small>HITEWASH</small>
<i>and</i> A<small>GATHA</small>)</p>

<p>P<small>AWKINS</small>. Ah! werry good! Jines hands and gives the paternal blessing!
All right and proper! But wot good comes to me on it all? It strikes me you are a rum
lot—you are. There’s this ’ere wenerable party—(D<small>E</small> W<small>INDSOR</small>)
asks me to ’is house—gives me a hice, which doesn’t agree with me, and does me out o’
three bob at cards! Here’s another chap (F<small>ERGUSON</small>) as talks as if he had
gooseberries in his mouth, and tries to stop my windpipe. Then here’s a sort o’
costermonger in disguise (T<small>HWAITES</small>) as interferes with my young ’oman.—And
here—(W<small>HITEWASH</small>) here’s the wust villain on ’em all. Ladies and gents, if
I’m in any trouble touching your good-will—him’s the party you must pitch into—cos vy?
Don’t you see? He’s retained for the defence.</p>

<p>W<small>HITE</small>. That won’t do! I haven’t had a refresher.</p>

<p>P<small>AWKINS</small>. Haven’t you? Then take your refresher there—(<i>pointing to</i>
A<small>UDIENCE</small>) that’s my refresher. Give me them ’ere parties on my side, and
hang me if I’ll want any defence at all!</p>

<p>This transcription is based on images digitized by Google from a copy made available by
the University of Illinois and posted by the HathiTrust at:</p>

<p>In general, this transcription attempts to retain the punctuation and spelling of the
source text. A few changes were made for the sake of consistency and to correct minor
errors.</p>

<p>The following changes were noted:</p>

<ul>
<li>p. 2: Changed the name “Fergusson” in both the character list and the costume notes to
“Ferguson” to be consistent with how the name is spelled elsewhere in the text.</li>

<li>p. 5: W<small>HITE</small>. (<small>L</small>. <small>C</small>.) Most acutely!
<i>wringing his hand</i>)—Inserted an opening parenthesis before “<i>wringing</i>”.</li>

<li>p. 11: (<i>some of the</i> C<small>OMPANY</small> <i>pass across at back of</i>
<small>C</small>. <i>doors, from</i>, <small>L</small>. <i>to</i>
<small>R</small>.)—Deleted the comma after “<i>from</i>”.</li>

<li>p. 14: D<small>E</small> W. (<i>aside</i>) Why, Mr. Pawkins, what’s the cause of this
singular hurry?—Pawkins’ and Whitewash’s subsequent lines indicate that both hear De
Windsor. Therefore, the direction indicating that this line is an aside was deleted.</li>

<li>p. 17: Gov’nor can’t be coming the old soldier!—Changed “Gov’nor” to “Gov’ner” for
consistency.</li>

<li>p. 18: Tango will have my daughter. ha, ha, ha!—Changed the period after “daughter” to
an em dash.</li>

<li>p. 18: Mr. De Winter, allow me to remark—Changed “De Winter” to “De Windsor” for
consistency.</li>

<li>p. 19: They say we were found in a cupboard at three o’ clock in the morning.—Deleted
the space before “clock” for consistency.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that Thwaites re-enters on p. 21 when he delivers a letter to Whitewash, but there
is no stage direction for Thwaites to exit after Pawkins tells him to “drop Miss Jemima”
on p. 20. He could exit either at the end of Pawkins’ speech or when De Windsor apologizes
to Pawkins.</p>
